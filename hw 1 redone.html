    <h1>Values and Morals of the Young Adult Genre</h1>
    <h2>By Katelyn McCall </h2>
    <p>The Young Adult genre is a set of literature (fiction, more often than not)
        specifically written for ages 12-18. With the subgenres:</p> 
        <ul class="styled-ul">
            <li class="contemp">Contemporary</li>
            <li>Paranormal</li>
            <li class="fantasy">Fantasy</li>
            <li class="dystopian">Dystopian</li>
            <li class="steampunk">Steampunk</li>
            <li class="science">Science Fiction</li>
            <li class="history">Historical</li>
            <li>Thriller/Suspense/Mystery</li>
            <li>Nonfiction</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some examples of these are (as in order above):</p>
        <ol class="deep">
            <li><span class="booktitle">Fangirl</span> by Rainbow Rowell</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">Daughter of Smoke and Bone</span> by Laini Taylor</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">An Ember in the Ashes</span> by Sabaa Tahir</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">Legend</span> by Marie Lu</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">Levithan</span> by Scott Westerfeld</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">Cinder</span> by Marissa Meyer</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">Salt to the Sea</span> by Ruta Sepetys </li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">We Were Liars</span> by E. Lockhart</li>
            <li><span class="booktitle">The 57 Bus: A True Story of Two Teenagers
                and the Crime That Changed Their Lives</span> by Dashka Slater</li>
        </ol>
        
    <p>Though most of the genre is considered to be 
        speculative fiction, and often overlooked in the 
        classroom, often chalked up as not real literature. 
        There are many morals and vlues to be gained from reading such literature.
        Take Suzanne Collins' <em>Hunger Games</em> (a, now considered classic, YA series 
        that is getting a sequel/prequel later in the year). Though most people consider
        Collins' novel series to be quite brutaul, with the excessive amount of murder. 
        While others tend to focus on the love triangle strewn throughout the series. 
        Hence the whole Peeta vs. Gale debate that overtook the literature world.
        But beyond the tropes and archetypes, <em>Hunger Games</em> is a series
        that taught the audience to stand up for their beliefs,
        even when the world tries to silence them. 
        
        But the <em>Hunger Games</em> is not the only book in the YA genre that had such
        monumental morals and values. Let's look back to the ones above:
        <ol class="outline">
            <li>Change is inevitable, but that doesn't mean you have to change as well.
                When the world tries to deny you of your individuality, the best thing
                is to remain yourself. </li>
            <li>Family does not always mean those realted by blood, family can be
                the people you found along the way.</li>
            <li>You are never as insignificant as you might believe. The world might say otherwise,
                but listen to your gut and you'll find your way through life. </li>
            <li>Every day means a new beginning, a new set of 24 hours for you to restart or change.</li>
            <li>Whatever a boy can do, a girl can do so much better, with the help of some friends of course.</li>
            <li>Looks can be decieving, but what you know in your heart matters the most.</li>
            <li>History often repeats itself, but we are too blind to see and learn from these past mistakes. 
                So take the time to crack open a book and see where our ancestors went wrong, and how you can avoid it.</li>
            <li>The brain can be a powerful thing, especially when hiding things are undesirable to rememeber.</li>
            <li>The world may appear to be random and unpredictable, but things tend to happen for a reason.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> Even so, the main take away from this whole spiel on the YA genre, is that it may never be considered a true genre
            worth any real academic value. But thats not the point of it. YA is supposed to be a <strong>fun</strong> piece of media
            that was designed to <strong>entertain and provoke</strong> the adolescent mind, with the added flair of the occasional
            witch, cyborg, or renegade protagonist. Not to mention to inspire hope for the years and generations to come. </p>
            <p class="quote">
            After all, "<strong>hope</strong> can be a powerful force. Maybe there's no actual <strong>magic</strong> in it, but 
            when you know what you <strong>hope</strong> for most and hold it like a light within you, you can make things happen, 
            almost like <strong>magic</strong>."
